# ENTER DESCRIPTON OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS

A voice-controlled app interface displayed on a tablet screen, enabling users to control a smart TV in a modern living room setup. The interface prominently features a circular remote control UI with voice activation functionality, along with volume and navigation buttons. This type of interface is part of the growing trend of smart home automation, where users interact with devices through voice commands rather than traditional remotes. It enhances convenience, accessibility, and user experience by allowing hands-free control of entertainment systems.
